        <p>The experience learning the basics of web development was great as I followed instructions by the lecturer that was uploading PowerPoints to NILE in my opinion, everything has been amazing and easy to understand without issues the only thing that has happened that it is that my website has broke on mobile version due to my mistake by deleting the style.css file even though I have put the same code in and still has failed to back to original idea.
            Module experience has been an awesome experience this is the only module that I have been enjoying in my own time and class room this is where I messed about with the codes and tried to learn new things from different YouTubers and styles on how to code and create a website portfolio.
            The design decision has been all random I tried to stick with an idea from the start but, that was difficult as it was more time consuming so, I switched to the basic and learn all the things before I started taking ideas from different websites the best lesson I learnt is to test the possibilities out there before I create a real portfolio.
            My original ide has been from a website that is named by a YouTuber Louis Armstrong this is where I gained the passion to create something similar to his but that was difficult but, after this the possibilities to recreate what he has is possible as Iâ€™ve learnt many things from the module and in my own time.
